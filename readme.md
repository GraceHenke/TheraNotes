## Problem 
A popular therapy treatment to use while helping a client deal with anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy, or more commonly known as CBT therapy. This treatment requires the client to identify and reframe their anxious thoughts. To do this, the client needs some way of being able to write down their intrusive thoughts throughout the day. 

## Solution
Clients need to be able to have a quick and easily accessible way to keep track of different thoughts they are having throughout the day, so I created a website that allows therapy clients (or anyone who wants to track their thoughts) to create different entries that allow them to label, reframe, and then identify how much anxiety these thoughts cause them.


## What TheraNotes Does:
TheraNotes allows clients to login and register with the site. By creating an account, clients will be allowed to keep their innermost thoughts private and personal. Once they are logged in, they will have access to their dashboard. On their dashboard they can view the recent thoughts they have been struggling with. There is also a graph depicting their anxiety levels over time, which will show thought patterns, and hopefully prompt the client into identifying an improvement in anxiety as they go through therapy. 

Another part of TheraNotes is the ability to create new entries. This section allows the user to identify the thought pattern they are experiencing. If the client is having a hard time identifying their feeling, there is an information button that will take them to a reputable site explaining different thought patterns. After they have identified the thought pattern, the entry then leads them through expounding, challenging the thought, and then finally how they are feeling. 


## How To Use
Simply download and install the required node packages, connect to a database (I used MongoDB) and enter a secret for the server to use. Then in a terminal: node TherapyServer.js
